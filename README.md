# STUPID POINTLESS MALWARE

## wat

So okay look. I have been playing with malware for way too god damn long and you
know what? I'm tired of RATs. I mean okay. They're pretty cool spy tools. Sure.
More power to the developers, you do you. But ya'll are just too god damn SERIOUS.

I mean I'm not saying you don't have a sense of humor. You do. You're a frigging
hacker, the entire stage is a god damn comedy to you, no doubt. (It sure is to me
anyway, lol, привет Руссиа!) But when it comes to the craft it's just all ownage and no flair!

I mean, yeah, you *shouldn't* have flair if you're busting into a place and
fucking up the joint, duh, don't do that, that shit just gives you away. But why
not create a really fucking bizarre distraction? Why not hijack the mouse and make
it go opposite directions so the mark basically goes "wat, IT help plz, teh mouse
is teh b0rken." Maybe you *need* that kind of stupid distraction!

But then maybe you're like me and you just want to be a huge fucking dork punking
the fuck out of people's systems. Just harmless, stupid bullshit that makes the
box do strange things. Hell maybe some marks will even *like* their new viral
buddies, informing them of the benefits of perhaps smoking the weed every time
the sun rises in the east.

I miss the stupid malware of the 90s and this is my attempt to write stuff in that
vein. If you download an exe from this repo omfg you should probably run it in a
VM. Or don't, if you're gutsy.
